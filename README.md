Project in classification TTT4275 with Eivind Heldal Stray


The project is divided into two tasks. Task one is to classify iris flowers from Fisher's Iris data set into Irs setosa, 
Iris virginica and Iris versicolor by length and widht of the sepals and petals. For the iris dataset a linear classifier will
be used as the iris data set is a linearly separated problem. Task two is to classify vowels pronounced by men, women, boys 
and girls. The vowel classification problem is a nonseparable problem and will be solved by MLE classifier.
