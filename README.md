# ClassificationTTT4275
Project in classification TTT4275 with Eivind Heldal Stray


The project is divided into two tasks. Task one is to classify iris flowers from Fisher's Iris data set into Iris setosa, 
Iris virginica and Iris versicolor by length and widht of the sepals and petals. For the iris dataset a linear classifier is used as the iris data set is close to a linearly separated problem and the classifier will be trained using a MSE (mean-squared-error) approach. Task two is to classify 12 different vowels pronounced by men, women, boys and girls. The vowel classification problem is a nonseparable problem and is solved by a non linear classifier trained using the ML (maximum likelihood) approach.
